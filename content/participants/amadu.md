# My Biography 
I am Amadu Wurie Baha a 25 years old who was born in a small village called “Kanikay” in Bombalili District, Northern province, sierra Leone. My dad rear cattle and my mother is a vegetable grower. Both of hem stays in the village. I am the first child to my mother but not the first to my father. My father married two wives. So, I have elder brothers and sisters from my step mother. I have six little brothers from the same mother “Lamin”, Chernor Mamadu”, Mamadu Jula”, “Zakaria”, “Alphajor” and “Mamud”. My two elder sisters “Hawa and Adama” are already married. Hawa is married to a driver in Guinea and Adama is married to a cattle owner who stays in Makeni. One of my older brother “Alhaji” is a driver and he stays in Freetown and my oldest brother “Alpha” stays with my father and mother in the village. My step mother died in 2015. May her soul rest in peace.
During the civil war I Sierra Leone, my parents relocated to Guinea a neighboring country. After the war ended, we returned back to sierra Leone. In 2003/2004 academic I started going to school in my native village Kanikay. In 2005/2016 academic year, I left my native village for Magburaka Town to stay with my late Aunty. May her soul rest in peace. 
However, because of my outstanding performance, I spent only four years in my primary schooling. I was awarded double promotion twice. After I sat to my National Primary School Examination (NPSE), I came out with flying color, I proceeded my secondary schooling at the Pampana High School Magburaka where I sat to West Africa Secondary School Certificate Examination (WASSCE). I also came out with flying color. I decided to pursue my undergraduate studies at the University of Makeni. Currently, am a final year student at the University of Makeni studying BSc in Computer Science
During my time at Ahmadiyya Primary school, I served as class prefect for class three, four and became the senior prefect while I was in class six. During my time at the Pampana High School Magburaka, I served as a Minister of information in JSS three and also served as Minister of Information in SSS Four. 
When I was in my secondary school, my dream was to become a lawyer. But my dad never wanted me to become a lawyer. In 2012, a friend of mine was working in a computer center. So, through his influence, I had the opportunity to touch a computer. I started learning how to type. That was the time I started understanding the concept of Computer and how it works. 
After completing my secondary school, my father bought me a laptop computer. But I never knew how to operate with a computer that much. All I knew by that time was to type word document and play music and videos. 
However, because of my little knowledge which I have in computer, people started trusting me with their PCs and smartphones to configure them to connect to the internet. That was the time I got the passion to study computer science. 
More so, I am working as an intern at LINK Corporation Limited as a Data Analyst and Web Developer.
