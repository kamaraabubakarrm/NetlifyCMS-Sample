# Project 1: Initial SiLNoRF website
This is our first project. During this project we develop a basic 'business card' website for the Makeni based NGO, Silnorf. During this project we our main focus is on teamwork, code quality and the Scrum methodology. 

For this project we ask the students to work in a Scrum Team of 4 people. The coach will have the role of product owner.

## Main objectives
- Build and host the initial version of the SiLNoRF website. 
- ##### Learn to work in a self-organising Scrum Team.
- Further improve Git capacities.
- Learn about code quality and programming principles relevant for web development

## Assignment Methodology - Self-Organising Scrum Team
During this assignment we ask you to work as a Scrum Team. Scrum is a popular framework for organising software development projects. It has been popular for quite some time now, and for good reasons; it has proven to be very effective and on top of that, people who use it, really enjoy doing it.
