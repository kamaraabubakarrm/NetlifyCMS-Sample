The Sierra Leone Network on the Right to Food (SiLNoRF) is a consortium of Civil Society, Local NGOs and Community Based Organizations operating in Sierra Leone. SiLNoRF is registered as a Not for Profit organization with the Office of the Registrar General of Companies in Sierra Leone. SiLNoRF is a member of the African Network on the Right to Food (ANoRF). The idea of setting up an organization or a Network that will do advocacy on the right to food in Africa came about as a result of the burning issues like petroleum crisis and soaring food prices discussed at the World Social Forum held in Nairobi, Kenya in 2007, where a lot of CSOs were represented from across the continent. Mohamed S. Conteh (National Coordinator of SiLNoRF) was one of the CSO representatives to that Forum where the idea to set up an African Network on the Right to Food was born.\
The African Network on the Right to Food (ANoRF) was established in 2008 in Cotonou, Benin and Mohamed S. Conteh was appointed as Focal person for Sierra Leone. In July, 2008, Mr. Conteh pioneered and collaborated with Abass J. Kamara then Human Rights Committee Chairperson for Bombali District, for the establishment of the local network which is the Sierra Leone Network on the Right to Food (SiLNoRF) by bringing together other Civil Society Organizations working in the areas of Human Rights Advocacy. Since 2008, SiLNoRF has been engaged in Right to Food Advocacy and Land Grabbing particularly focusing on womenâ€™s access to land for farming.
