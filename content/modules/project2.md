# Project 2: Using a static site generator
The second iteration of the SiLNoRF website will have more content and a refined layout. During this project we will switch to using a static site generator, that allows us to make a separation between content and styling. This makes it much easier to add new content to the website, and even opens the door to add full CMS functionality to the site in future iterations.

For this project our main goals are to improve upon the existing website and to improve upon it's technical design. A new skill the students will focus on is working with a static site generator. Hugo in particular. In addition to this we will continue practicing the skills, Html & Css design, Git/Github and Scrum.

## Expected outcomes
By working on this project we expect the students to learn the following:

- Build the second iteration of the SiLNoRF website.
- Make use of the static site generator Hugo to build the website.
- Improve self-organising Scrum Team capacities.
- Further improve Git capacities.

## Assignment Methodology - Self-Organising Scrum Team

- Sprint 2: Friday 26th Juny to Thursday 2nd July.

During these Sprints, the team will be responsible for organising and creating the following events and artefacts:

### artefacts
