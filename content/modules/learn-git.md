# Module 1: Learn Git
Welcome to the first module of the Makeni Hub Project. In this module we think
about our input and our expectations for the Makeni Hub Project. While doing
this we will also learn to work with Git and Github.

Git is an open source  version control system (vcs). These day's it is the most popular vcs around, and for good reasons. It's completely free, and it is easy to use. 

For programmers this is an essential tool, because it enables them to work as a team effectively. But even for programmers who work on a project individually, Git can be a very valuable asset. 

Because of this we want you to spend some time to learn Git, or to improve your existing skills. For this we want you to make an assignment using Git and Github.


## Requirements

- [ ] Github account
- [ ] Git installed on computer
  - Other git clients are available, but for now we recommend you learn to use the command line tool.

## Assignment

- [ ] Make a fork of this project, and make sure you do the following assignments in your forked repository
- [ ] Think about your expectations for this project, and write down your answers in [project-expectations.md](project-expectations.md).
- [ ] Think about the skills, knowledge, mindsets, etc.., that you already have and can contribute to this project. Write down your answers to the question in [project-input.md](project-input.md).
- Use markdown syntax 
- [ ] Create a Pull request and have your changes merged into the main project

## expected outcomes

- The student can use basic Git commands to contribute to a project that is under version control
- The student can work together with others on a project that is under version control
- The student has expressed his expectations for this project and has aligned them with the coaches
