# Project Information
This project is part of a larger project between YMCA and Bread for the World a German development organization. You can read more about this project by following this link (https://makeni-hub-project.netlify.app/docs/ymca-cps-project.md).

Our goal for this project is to build a website for a local NGO, SiLNoRF. We want to take this chance to work together with local youths who have a background in Computer Science and are looking for chances to gain practical experience working on IT projects. This is you.

While you work with your colleagues to build the website for SiLNoRF, Daniel Samura (https://makeni-hub-project.netlify.app/docs/daniel-samura.md) and Robin Altena (https://makeni-hub-project.netlify.app/docs/robin-altena.md)  will coach you in this process. They will try to identify and teach you the things that you still need to learn, while helping you to get better at the things that you already can do.

The things we that we as coaches want to achieve in the coming weeks:
- Create a new website for Silnorf (https://makeni-hub-project.netlify.app/docs/silnorf-website.md)
- Identified learning goals for each of the students
- Students have improved their teamwork skills (Git + Github, Agile/Scrum methodology)
- Each student has an online portfolio to show his work

By working on these objectives we want to help the contribute to the YMCA CPS Project while also helping the students to improve their programming skills and to teach them to work on real life projects.

## Commitment from students
We ask each of the students to commit to the following:

1. To be open to learn new things and to think about solutions that are best for the local context of Sierra Leone;
2. To work in team based projects, where team members share knowledge and learn from each other;
3. To have a professional attitude, since we will be working with real life projects;
4. To be open to give and receive feedback and to have an attitude of self-improvement.
5. To have fun!

## Planning
The duration for this project will be 10 weeks. During these weeks we will work on 4 different modules and on 3 website projects. Please see the weekly planning for our day-to-day schedule. Below you can read more about the different modules for this project:
