# Module 2: Refresh HTML & CSS skills
In order to work well with more advanced frameworks, we need to have a good understanding of 2 fundamentals for web development. HTML and CSS. In this module we will take some time to refresh our existing skills.

## Assignments
For this module we want to work with various practical assignments which gives you extra opportunities to practice the skill needed for the first project. Also it gives us teachers the opportunity to give you feedback on your work and help you improve the aspects of your HTML & CSS skills that can be improved.

For this week it is our goal to finish the following exercises:
Assignment	When
Research predefined HTML or CSS topic	Tuesday
Create Personal Portfolio & CV website	Wednesday - Thursday
Create technical documentation (work in teams of 2)	Friday - Monday

## Expected outcomes
1. Learn how to host static website for free on Github pages (and alternatives)
2. Create a website using plain HTML and CSS
3. Cooperate on the coding aspects of a web development project
4. Learn to work with best practices in mind

## Learning resources
This week we have decided to give you no prescribed learning resources. Instead we ask you to work on the assignments above. Whenever you are in need of more information about a certain topic either do your own research or ask the teachers if they can provide you with good sources of information.
